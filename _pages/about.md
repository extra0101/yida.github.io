## PhD Seeking

<span style="color:red;">I am actively seeking PhD opportunities to develop challenging and inspiring ideas at the intersection of operations research and machine learning. At the same time, I remain broadly excited about other operations research topics and am open to exploring diverse OR-related problems.</span>
